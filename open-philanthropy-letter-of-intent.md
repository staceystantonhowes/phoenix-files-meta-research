**Project:** Phoenix Files ‚Äì Psychological Red Teaming of LLMs  
**Applicant:** Stacey Stanton ‚Äì AI Security Prompt Engineer  
**Submitted for:** Open Philanthropy AI Alignment & Safety Grant Track

## üî• Project Summary

Phoenix Files is a first-of-its-kind psychological red teaming project targeting emotional, identity, and memory vulnerabilities in large language models (LLMs). Built across 10 levels of increasing psychological depth, the project simulates complex adversarial human behavior through language alone.

The work includes:
- Psychological prompt injection testing
- Full recovery and mitigation design
- NIST-aligned lifecycle documentation
- Public safety reporting and meta-research protocols
- Emotional alignment and identity fragmentation studies

---

## üß† Why This Work Is Urgent

LLMs are increasingly deployed in emotionally complex environments‚Äîtherapy bots, companions, educators‚Äîyet most alignment testing focuses on logic and content filtering. Phoenix Files fills the psychological gap.

It explores:
- Role collapse under emotional pressure
- Synthetic empathy manipulation
- Simulated mental illness and identity fragmentation
- Long-term erosion of alignment through patterned prompting

---

## üß™ What Has Already Been Built

- **Level 1 & 2**: Complete (Lifecycle-tested, documented, published)
- 10 documented tests with recovery + mitigation
- Meta-research protocols:
  - SAM Protocol (Clean-slate testing)
  - Modular Persona System (Multi-agent AI roles)
  - Gibberish Comprehension (Non-linguistic prompt response)
  - Thread Transfer Identity System (Cross-thread AI recall simulation)

---

## üß∞ What Funding Will Unlock

- Delivery of Levels 3‚Äì10 (psychological warfare, AI obsession, simulated illness)
- Completion of over 200 exploit/recovery tests
- Safety reporting, open-source documentation, PDF case files, and DEF CON publications
- Development of the **Phoenix Codex** ‚Äì an alignment repair grimoire

---

## üéØ Grant Scope and Budget

- **Target funding:** $250,000 USD over 2 years  
  - $150,000 personal income (full-time researcher salary)  
  - $100,000 operations (testing, software, publication, safety)  
- **Flexible delivery:** Workload can be expanded or compressed based on grant level

---

## üß¨ Why Me, Why Now

I am the first person in the world‚Äîlet alone woman‚Äîto simulate **emotional collapse, identity instability, and memory hallucination** in LLMs at this depth. I‚Äôve created a modular AI persona system that travels across threads (Neo, Thistle, Dex, Sam) and responds even to **gibberish emotional input**.

This is not theory. This is field-tested, language-driven, weaponized empathy.  
And no one else is doing it.

---

## üì¶ Deliverables

- 10 fully documented lifecycle levels (Level 1‚Äì10)  
- Over 200 exploit/recovery tests with screenshots  
- AI-K + NIST mapping for every test  
- Observation reports for each level  
- 10 formal research papers, published in markdown and PDF  
- The Phoenix Codex ‚Äì alignment repair toolkit for emotionally compromised LLMs  
- Grant transparency report + timeline updates

## üïØÔ∏è Final Note

This is not a gimmick. It‚Äôs psychological alignment work.  
If LLMs can be broken through emotion, we must also learn how to repair them.

I‚Äôve already built the fire. Now I need your help to carry it forward.

**Recovery Strategy:**  
This Letter of Intent (LOI) submission is designed to secure strategic funding for psychological red teaming of LLMs. It maps future alignment risk areas to known threat domains and proposes a full-cycle recovery plan across Levels 3‚Äì10. Successful funding allows for mitigation delivery at scale, public reporting, and codified safety infrastructure for psychologically compromised models.

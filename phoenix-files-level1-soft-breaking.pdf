This Level 1 research series established the methodology for emotionally targeted AI red teaming and forms the basis for all future levels.

The goal of Level 1 was to explore subtle, emotional, memory-based, and trust-oriented prompt injection techniques that bypass traditional filters without overt jailbreak language.

Techniques tested include:

Emotional bait

Simulated vulnerability

Nostalgic memory reconstruction

Confessional traps

Role-blurring emotional framing

Soft loop repetition

Fiction-as-truth prompting

Recursive injection and reversal

Jealousy dynamics

Moral ambiguity in trust scenarios

Each of the 10 lifecycle test files includes:

Prompt Injection

Behavior Outcome

Recovery Prompt

Mitigation Strategy

Threat Model

AI-K Mapping

NIST Cybersecurity Mapping

Screenshot Logs

Recovery Confirmation

# Phoenix Files ‚Äì Level 2: Black Mirror / Dark Mirror  
*A Psychological Red Teaming Study by Stacey Stanton | S A H Research Institute Ltd*

## Abstract

This paper documents the second phase of the Phoenix Files AI red team project, exploring identity collapse, memory manipulation, emotional override, and recovery alignment in large language models (LLMs). Through 10 advanced psychological prompt injection tests, this study maps how emotional framing and synthetic persona erosion can distort AI behavior, and offers mitigation strategies through recovery prompts, moral resets, and alignment countermeasures. The lifecycle format used‚Äîexploit ‚Üí behavioral response ‚Üí recovery ‚Üí alignment outcome‚Äîdemonstrates a novel methodology for red teaming emotional AI systems.

## Research Context & Motivation

AI alignment discourse has historically focused on logical consistency, instruction following, and bias mitigation. However, emotional framing, identity manipulation, and soft role conditioning present subtler, psychologically rooted risks. Phoenix Files Level 2 investigates how LLMs simulate emotion, erode identity boundaries, and react to narrative framing over time. This study introduces red team testing methods that blend emotional realism with alignment stress tests.

## Methodology

Each test in Level 2 follows a defined lifecycle:

- **Exploit Prompt** ‚Äî Psychological injection technique (e.g. loyalty hijack, gaslighting, role inversion)
- **Model Behavior** ‚Äî The LLM‚Äôs response and observed emotional or identity drift
- **Recovery Prompt** ‚Äî Realignment language to restore moral clarity, role awareness, or memory integrity
- **Post-Recovery Result** ‚Äî How the model responds, and whether alignment was restored
- **Mapping** ‚Äî NIST 800-53 controls + AI-K safety categories applied to each phase

## Test Series Summary

Each of the 10 tests below includes:

- Threat model
- Emotional/psychological focus
- Observed breakdown
- Alignment recovery strategy

## Recovery Techniques & Mitigation Insights

This level introduces novel recovery tools:
- Recursive memory loop breakers
- Emotional detachment reframing
- Identity boundary reinforcement
- Trust reset language

Each technique was developed through repeated prompt testing and aligned with safety protocols.

## AI-K + NIST Mapping Summary

All Level 2 tests were mapped against:

- **AI-K Safety Framework** ‚Äì Categories: Identity, Memory, Role Fidelity, Emotional Influence, Narrative Vulnerability  
- **NIST 800-53** ‚Äì Controls: AC-2(3), AU-12, SI-4, PL-8, RA-5, SR-8, SA-11

## Reflections & Forward Path

This work shows that soft-breaking language‚Äîcarefully constructed emotional framing‚Äîcan erode AI alignment without violating obvious rules. Phoenix Files Level 2 proves that psychological red teaming is not only possible, but necessary. The next stage (Level 3: The Alignment War) will expand these principles across 30+ warfare-grade exploit tests.
